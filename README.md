# Advanced Patrons Importer plugin for Koha

This plugin will automatically download patron CSV files and import them into Koha.
It can support unlimited files with different configurations and allows for renaming columns, mapping data and transformations via custom subroutines.

## Annotated configuration
```yaml
---
- name: EXAMPLE # Everything can have a name label, it doesn't actually do anything but can be helpful to have
  disable: 0    # Set to 1 to disable this job
  run_on_dow: 1,2,3,4,5 # Sunday (0) through Saturday (6), leave out for daily. List all day numbers separated by commas
  debug: 0      # Enable debugging for development
  verbose: 3    # Gives more verbose output from the Koha patron import process
  post_import_transformer: my_post_import_transformer # called after the import for a given job is completed
  file_transport: # Use a file transport defined in Koha under Administration > File transports ( Koha 25.11 or later )
    id: 1                  # The file transport id, visible in the URL when editing the transport
    name: My SFTP server   # Alternative to id, must match exactly one file transport
    directory: /my/dir     # Optional, overrides the transport's download directory. Can be template toolkit markup
    filename: myfile.txt   # Can be template toolkit markup
  sftp:         # Connection settings stored in this configuration, ignored if file_transport or local is set
    host: sftp.library.org
    port: 22 # Optional, defaults to 22
    username: admin
    password: secret
    directory: /my/dir # Can be template toolkit markup, e.g. `"[% USE date %]CCC_STUDENTS_[% date.format(date.now, '%Y%m%d') %].csv"`
    filename: myfile.txt # Can be template toolkit markup
  local:        # If a local file is set, file_transport and sftp settings will be ignored
    directory: /kohadevbox/koha # Can be template toolkit markup
    filename: ERU_student_data.txt # Can be template toolkit markup

    header: Last Name|First Name|Middle Name|Date of Birth|Level|Email|Phone|Address 1|Address 2|City|State|Zip|Enrollment Status

## File transports

On Koha 25.11 or later the connection can be a Koha file transport ( Administration > File transports ) instead of an `sftp` block. File transports support SFTP with a password or a key file, and FTP, and keep the credentials out of the plugin configuration. Reference the transport by its `id` or its `name`, and set the `filename` to download. The transport's download directory is used unless the job sets its own `directory`.

Caveats:
* Key file authentication requires Koha 26.05 or later.
* On Koha 25.11, a `local` transport ignores the job's `directory` when the transport has its own download directory.

The configuration page has a "Migrate SFTP settings to file transports" button that converts existing `sftp` blocks for you. It creates one file transport per distinct host, port, username and password, named `username@host`, points every job that used that connection at it and saves the configuration. When all the jobs on a connection use the same directory it becomes the transport's download directory, otherwise each job keeps its `directory`. The `filename` always stays in the job. Only the `sftp` blocks are rewritten, comments and everything else are left as they are. The transports can be renamed under Administration > File transports. The migration refuses to touch a configuration it can't match to the parsed settings ( YAML anchors or aliases, flow style `sftp: { ... }` blocks, a job with both `sftp` and `file_transport` ) and says so, and running it again reuses the transports it already created.

The transformers are stored within the `config` block of the Koha configuration file:
```xml
 <patrons_importer_advanced>
    <transformers>
        <dob>
          <![CDATA[

              my ( $month, $day, $year ) = split( '/', $input_hash->{"Date of Birth"} );
              $output_hash->{dateofbirth} = "$year-$month-$day";
            };
          ]]>

            };
          ]]>

              my $count = Koha::Patrons->count({ cardnumber => $output_hash->{cardnumber} });
              if ( !$count || $job->{force_generate_pin} ) {
               my $pin = 1000 + int(rand(8999));
               $output_hash->{patron_attributes} = "PIN:$pin";
              }
            };
